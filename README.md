# Splitter-app
A SOA based web application that splits expenses in a group.
Consists of 3 microservices

2. Start Splitter app service on local host port 3000. rails s -p 3000 is the command
3. Start the SMS service  on local host port 4000 if required. rails s -p 4000 is the command.

2. Users can add transactions/bill expenses with friends in groups and normally.
3. Create your own groups.
